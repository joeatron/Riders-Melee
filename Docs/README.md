From "Resources.md":

Game-Datasheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JjGnUaelTYLCMGntBX2LREhlO2wSbBGApSVH9JA_WGo/edit?usp=sharing (this is a backup of the pre DX and 1.4+ datasheet, its out of date but I will add anything I find in to it)

Texture-Datasheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1m6ykDFHT4lynSRy0XOpj-xFkTiiJXg38UJL8fdb0vjg/edit?usp=sharing (This is a data sheet of every texture ID that I have located so far, I will update it weekly as I find more textures) (If you know any and would like it to be added just make a issue of it contatining the ID, the texture and where it is located)

IF you have any other resources I should put here, please let me know
